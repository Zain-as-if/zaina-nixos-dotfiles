Make sure keyring actually available:

1. 
bash
busctl --user list | grep Secret 

if you see something or this:
org.freedesktop.secrets 

then working

2. 
nmcli connection delete "eduroam" 

do this if eduroam shows in:
nmcli connection show

3.
reconnect to eduroam 
nmcli device wifi connect "eduroam" --ask

enter password

4. 
Verify its fixed 

nmcli connection show "eduroam" | grep psk-flags 

should be 0 -> pass stored in keyring


5.

further verify by either rebooting or:

nmcli device disconnect wlp2s0
nmcli device connect wlp2s0 

this mimics a reboot for the network
if automatically connects to eduroam then works
